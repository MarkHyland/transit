The code shown for this project is the back end half.  When a front ender 
adds the specified routes, they receive the data through the wmata API
or the bikeshare API in the form of JSON.

For this project, I collaborated with a front-ender.  Her name is Ghaea.
We posted our working App to Heroku.  Don't forget to allow Location!
